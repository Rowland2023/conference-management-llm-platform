# Conference Management System API
Conference Management System API is a production-ready backend platform for managing conferences, ticketing, registrations, payments, and notifications. It demonstrates how to build modular, event-driven business applications using Domain-Driven Design, Clean Architecture, and reliable messaging patterns suitable for production systems.

A production-ready, Domain-Driven Design (DDD) conference management platform built with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Sequelize**. The system is designed around modular architecture, event-driven principles, and enterprise patterns including **Transactional Outbox**, **Optimistic Concurrency Control**, and **CQRS-inspired application services**.

# Architecture

```

Each module is autonomous and contains its own:

* Domain
* Application
* Infrastructure
* Presentation

This minimizes coupling while maximizing maintainability and scalability.

# Domain-Driven Design

Each module follows a layered DDD architecture.

# Domain Events

Business state changes are represented as immutable domain events.

Examples include:

* TicketCreated
* TicketReserved
* TicketReleased
* TicketPurchased
* TicketCancelled
* TicketExpired
* PaymentInitialized
* PaymentSucceeded
* RegistrationCreated

Each event inherits from the shared `DomainEvent` base class, providing:

* Event ID
* Aggregate ID
* Event Name
* Event Version
* Correlation ID
* Causation ID
* Timestamp
* Immutable Payload

---

# Transactional Outbox Pattern

The system guarantees reliable event publishing by persisting domain events and aggregate state within the same database transaction.

```

      │
      ▼

      │
      ▼

      └── Commit Transaction
      │
      ▼
Outbox Publisher
      │
      ▼
Kafka / RabbitMQ
```

This approach prevents lost events while ensuring consistency between the database and message broker.

---

# Optimistic Concurrency

Aggregates use optimistic concurrency control through a version column.

Typical update:

```
UPDATE tickets
SET reserved = ?, version = version + 1
WHERE id = ?
AND version = ?;
```

This prevents concurrent updates from overwriting one another.

---

# Repository Pattern

Repositories encapsulate persistence logic.

Responsibilities include:

* Loading aggregates
* Saving aggregates
* Persisting domain events to the outbox
* Transaction management
* Optimistic concurrency enforcement

Repositories do **not** contain business rules.

---

# Data Mapper Pattern

Data mappers translate between persistence models and domain models.

```
Database
      │
      ▼
Mapper
      │
      ▼
Aggregate
```

This keeps domain entities independent of the ORM.
